ObjectBox Dart & Flutter
==========================

ObjectBox is a super-fast database storing Dart objects locally.

* üèÅ **High performance** - improving response rates and enabling real-time applications.
* ü™Ç **ACID compliance** - Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durable.
* üîó **Relations** - object links / relationships are built-in.
* üå± **Scalable** - grows with your app, handling millions of objects with ease.
* üíê **Queries** - filter data as needed, even across relations.
* ü¶Æ **Statically typed** - compile time checks & optimizations.
* üíª **Multiplatform** - Android, iOS, macOS, Linux, Windows.
* üìÉ **Schema migration** - change your model with confidence.
* üë• [**ObjectBox Sync**](https://objectbox.io/sync/) - keeps data in sync offline or online, between devices and servers.

## Sneak peek

```dart
@Entity()
class Person {
  int id;

  String firstName;
  String lastName;
}

// Note: in Flutter you also need to specify a directory, see examples.
final store = Store(getObjectBoxModel());
final box = store.box<Person>();

var person = Person()
  ..firstName = "Joe"
  ..lastName = "Green";

final id = box.put(person);  // Create

person = box.get(id);        // Read

person.lastName = "Black";
box.put(person);             // Update

box.remove(person.id);       // Delete

// find all people whose name start with letter 'J'
final query = box.query(Person_.firstName.startsWith('J')).build();
final people = query.find();  // find() returns List<Person>
```

Getting started
---------------

Add the following dependencies to start using ObjectBox and code generator.

### Flutter mobile apps

```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^0.10.0
  objectbox_flutter_libs: any

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `flutter pub get`
* XCode/iOS: under Architectures replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD)` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`). See [FAQ](#faq) for details.

### Dart CLI apps or Flutter desktop apps

```yaml
dependencies:
  objectbox: ^0.10.0

dev_dependencies:
  build_runner: ^1.0.0
  objectbox_generator: any
```

* Install the packages: `(flutter|dart) pub get`
* Install [objectbox-c](https://github.com/objectbox/objectbox-c) system-wide (use "Git bash" on Windows):

  ```shell script
  bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/objectbox/objectbox-dart/main/install.sh)
  ```

* macOS: dart later complain that it cannot find the `libobjectbox.dylib`. You probably have to unsign the `dart`
  binary - see [this dart issue](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/issues/38314#issuecomment-534102841) for details.

* Windows: copy the downloaded `lib/objectbox.dll` to `C:\Windows\System32\` (requires admin privileges).

Help wanted
-----------

ObjectBox Dart is still not on par with other language bindings where ObjectBox is available.
To bring all the missing features to Dart, we're asking the community to help out. PRs are more than welcome!
The ObjectBox team will try its best to guide you and answer questions.

### Feedback

Also, please let us know your feedback GitHub issues, either comment on an existing one or open a new one.
For example, if you experience errors or if you have ideas for how to improve the API.

FAQ
---

**Q:** After adding ObjectBox, the size of the APK increased significantly. Why is that?<br />
**A:** Flutter compresses its native libraries (.so files) by default in the APK.
ObjectBox instructs the Android build to use uncompressed native libraries instead
(following the [official Android recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/reduce-apk-size#extract-false)).
This setting affects the Flutter native libraries as well. Thus the now uncompressed Flutter libraries add to the APK size as well;
we've seen an additional 19 MB for the standard Flutter libraries.
_This is bad, right?_ Nope, actually uncompressed libraries use **less** storage space on device and have other advantages.
For details, please review the [official Android recommendations](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/reduce-apk-size#extract-false)
and the [ObjectBox FAQ entry](https://docs.objectbox.io/faq#how-much-does-objectbox-add-to-my-apk-size) on this.
Both links also explain how to force compression using `android:extractNativeLibs="true"`.

**Q:** Flutter iOS builds for armv7 fail with "ObjectBox does not contain that architecture", does it not support 32-bit devices?<br />
**A:** No, only 64-bit iOS devices are supported. When ObjectBox was first released for iOS all the latest iOS devices had 64-bit support,
so we decided to not ship armv7 support. To resolve the build error, in your XCode project
look under Architectures and replace `${ARCHS_STANDARD)` with `arm64` (or `$ARCHS_STANDARD_64_BIT`).
